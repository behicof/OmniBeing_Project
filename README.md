# OmniBeing Project

## Overview
OmniBeing is an innovative project created by behicof. The project aims to integrate various machine learning models and data sources to provide advanced market predictions and analysis. The project leverages market, social, and global data to make accurate predictions and provide valuable insights for market analysis.

## Features
- Integration of multiple machine learning models
- Processing of market, social, and global data
- Advanced predictive systems for market analysis
- Automated testing for all predictive systems using `pytest`
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Parallel and distributed training techniques using `Dask` or `Spark`
- Model ensembling techniques like bagging or boosting
- Cloud-based services like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform for faster model training
- Real-time data processing pipelines for social and global data
- Sentiment analysis models for social and global data using advanced NLP techniques like BERT or GPT-3
- Scalable data storage and processing solutions for large volumes of data
- Data privacy and security measures for social and global data
- Continuous improvement process for sentiment analysis models
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Fetching, storing, and processing live market data from external platforms

## Installation
- Clone the repository
- Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Project
- Run the application with `python src/main/app.py`
- Run the new script to coordinate and run prediction systems with `python src/scripts/run_predictions.py`

## Testing
- Run the tests with `pytest`

## Configuration
- Update the configuration file `config.yaml` with the necessary details for fetching live market data and other settings.
- Update the configuration file `config_optimized.yaml` with the necessary details for optimized model settings.

## Troubleshooting
- Some packages like MetaTrader5 and pyaudio may not install correctly on certain systems. Ensure you have the necessary system dependencies installed.
- If you encounter issues with package installation, refer to the official documentation of the package for troubleshooting steps.
- Ensure that the `config.yaml` and `config_optimized.yaml` files are correctly configured with the necessary paths and API keys.
- If you face any specific errors, please provide the error message for more precise guidance.
